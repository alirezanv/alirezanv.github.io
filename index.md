Batch A 

# Day 1 : Introduction to Fablab 
"FabLab - MESCE” is digital manufacturing technology, combininig 2D and 3D design with the latest fabrication technology. Embracing a broad spectrum of methods ranging from CNC machining to 3D printing, and even PCB Milling. It can produce a single unique product from a digital design in a matter of minutes- and at a very low cost in comparison to traditional tooling methods.

HOW TO MAKE ALMOST ANYTHING..

We got an overview of how the seven days were going to be spent at FABLAB. We went through and just got introduced to all the machines we were going to use and play with. So, today we entered the magical world and were all set to explore more .

# Day 2 : Github Pages and Documentation

   Today we learnt how we could document our work and experiences through github pages and how we could essentially use them in the future. The documenting actually feels amazing. It is like writing memories that wouldn’t fade with time. On a serious note, one can always record such experiences and learning and also share. I think everyone must make it a habit to document whenever we learn a new thing so that it does not get erased even if we forget.

Maintaining github pages is pretty simple. All you have to do is to follow a few simple steps and you can share you’re own online document to anyone anywhere. Sounds awesome , doesnn’t it..

STEPS

-Create an account in github.just click on the link given

-Create your project’s repository. Login to your GitHub account and go to https://github.com/new or click the New repository icon from your account homepage.
-Name your repository username.github.io, replacing username with your GitHub username. Be sure it is public and go ahead and tell GitHub to create a README/index.md file upon generating the repo.

  Now that your repository is ready. Create a readme/index.md file .
Now you are ready to go. Open the file and edit it using markdown, html or anything of your choice. You can follow this link if you need help https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/



# Day 3: Electronics Production and CNC

CNC
Computer numerical control (CNC) is the automation of machine tools by means of computers executing pre-programmed sequences of machine control commands.This is in contrast to machines that are manually controlled by hand wheels or levers, or mechanically automated by cams alone-

      Our aim in this section was to complete PCB milling and cutting and also to solder the PCB. Unfortunately we couln’t accomplish this due to technical crisis as im an civil engineering student
                               
                               
# DAY 4 : Vinyl Cutting
A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl).

So, you could say vinyl cutting can be used to make your own customised stickers etc..It is fun to work with. We can just design anything and then cut it using the software
